## Why use oop


## 4 pillars of oop
- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism

## encapsulation
- reduce complexity + increase reusability
- reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
- increase reusability by allowing us to reuse objects in different parts of our application

## abstraction
- reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
- reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
- isolate impact of changes by localizing the effects of changes

## inheritance
- eliminate redundant code
- extend existing functionality
- reuse code

## polymorphism
- refactor ugly switch/case statements
- extend functionality
- refactor conditional logic
